#Ollie
:I know we only just met Y/N, but you made me realize so much… You showed me how to love again, when I thought I was hopeless. You made me feel as though I wasn’t alone during my loneliest times… I’ll always remember you. And perhaps I won’t feel as though I’ve left so much behind this time… You’ll keep my letters, right? 
#
:<i>Y/N blinks their eyes, trying to keep tears from escaping. 
#Y/N
:Yes Ollie. Of course I’ll keep them. 
#Ollie
:Good… Perhaps you can still mail them all out for me… Ah, right. I almost forgot. 
#Ollie
:Be sure to check under your pillow. I left one last special note, just for you. 
#Y/N
:Ollie… I have something for you too.
#
:<i>Y/N pulls a letter from their pocket, handing it to Ollie.
#Y/N
:I want you to take it with you… to remember me and our time together.
#
:<i>Ollie gives a sad smile. 
#Ollie
:Oh, Y/N. I’d never forget you. 
#
:<i>Light rises from their feet, and they slowly become transparent. The sound of sparkles faintly hums as they disappear.
#
:<i>Ollie closes their eyes, bracing what’s to come, the locket clutched tightly in one hand, the letter in the other, before disappearing.

#Mizuki
:Y/N… I know our time was short but thank you for accompanying me in my last moments on this earth. I died with many regrets but… your presence has given me the gift of renewal. Perhaps now, I can pass on peacefully.
#Y/N
:I’m glad that I was able to provide some comfort to you. 
#Mizuki
:You did, I truly appreciated it.
#
:<i>Mizuki curls the corners of her mouth ever so slightly.
#Mizuki
:It was an honour to meet you, Y/N. It would be wonderful if we could meet again when your time comes.
#Y/N
:(sentimental) Without a doubt, I’ll come find you.
#Mizuki
:I look forward to it.
#
:<i>Light rises from her feet, and he slowly becomes transparent. The sound of sparkles faintly hums as she disappears.
#Mizuki
:May your light never be dimmed, in life or death. 
#
:<i>Mizuki gives Y/N a small bow before disappearing into the light, taking the sword with her.

#Alomar
:Guess this it, Y/N! I’ve learned so much in this time period. How amazing is it to travel so fast on land, to have all the books and knowledge of the world at your fingertips. 
#Alomar
:Truly, I wished I could have explored more. 
#Y/N
:I hope wherever you go, you get to meet with your crew again. 
#Alomar
:I do too! And I’ll tell them all about you! 
#
:<i>Alomar grabs Y/N’s hands. 
#Alomar
:Thanks for listening to me, Y/N! I hope I wasn’t too much of a bother!
#Y/N
:(sentimental) You really weren’t. I enjoyed your company. 
#Alomar
:That puts me at ease. 
#
:<i>Light rises from his feet, and he slowly becomes transparent. The sound of sparkles faintly hums as he disappears.
#Alomar
:It was a pleasure getting to know you. I’m glad I got to know you! 
#
:<i>Alomar gives Y/N a wink and a small wave before disappearing into the light, taking the sash with them.

#Y/N
:Ollie… I have something for you too.
#
:<i>Y/N pulls a letter sealed with a kiss from their pocket, handing it to Ollie.
#Y/N
:I want you to take it with you… to remember me and our time together.
#
:<i>Ollie gives a sad smile. 
#Ollie
:Oh, Y/N. I’d never forget you. 
#
:<i>Light rises from their feet, and they slowly become transparent. The sound of sparkles faintly hums.
#
:<i>Ollie closes their eyes, bracing what’s to come, the locket clutched tightly in one hand, the letter in the other.
#
:<i>Y/N tilts their head, thinking that Ollie would be disappearing to the afterlife. But they become more human. A bright light blasts from their feet, blinding Y/N.
#
:<i>The bright light fades. Y/N feels the warmth of their skin and sees the light in their eyes. 
#
:<i>Ollie stares at their hands and touches their face, shocked. They slowly lift their hands to cup Y/N’s face. Their face fades from surprise to affinity.
#Ollie
:Is it over? Am I dead? Why are you still here?
#
:<i>Y/N Ollie! I think you’re human again!
#Ollie
:What? Wait!!
#
:<i>Ollie pats themselves down again, and a smile lights up their entire face, for the first time. They have a really cute smile, you think. You want to see it more often, and now you can.
#Ollie
:I am real! I believe it was my feelings for you that kept me here. You would have known that if you had read that letter I left for you… But now I can tell you myself! This is my second chance at love… Do you love me too?
#
:<i>A smolder in Ollie’s eyes follows this question.
#Y/N
:Of course I love you, Ollie!
#
:<i>Ollie comes in for a hug. This is the first time they’ve ever felt so warm. It’s a weird contrast to their usual somber coolness. You could get used to this. 
#
:<i>You hear the clink of the locket fall to the ground and fade away into sparkles.

#Mizuki
:Y/N… I know our time was short but thank you for accompanying me in my last moments on this earth. I died with many regrets but… your presence has given me the gift of renewal. Perhaps now, I can pass on peacefully, with the belief that my mentor holds no blame against me.
#
:<i>She purses her lips, seeming to search for words.
#Mizuki
:I cherished every moment we spent together. Truly. I am glad our paths crossed in spite of the vastness of our universe.
#Y/N
:I’m glad that I was able to provide some comfort to you. Perhaps you’ll be able to reunite with your mentor in the afterlife. I’m sure there’ll be much to say between you two.
#Mizuki
:If I do manage to meet him again, I’ll be sure to speak of you.
#
:<i>Mizuki curls the corners of her mouth ever so slightly.
#Mizuki
:It was an honour to meet you, Y/N. It would be wonderful if we could meet again when your time comes.
#
:<i>Light rises from her feet, and the sound of sparkles faintly hums as she disappears.
#Mizuki
:What– what’s going on?
#
:<i>Y/N tilts their head, thinking that Mizuki would be disappearing to the afterlife. But she becomes more human. A bright light blasts from her feet, blinding Y/N.
#
:<i>The bright light fades. Y/N feels the warmth of her skin and sees the light in her eyes. 
#
:<i>Mizuki stares at her hands and touches her face, shocked. She carefully reaches her hand out to hold Y/N’s hand. Her face fades from surprise to affinity.
#Mizuki
:I– I think I’m human again.
#
:<i>Y/N grasps Mizuki’s hand back, pulling her into a gentle embrace. Silent tears gather in Mizuki’s eyes.
#Y/N
:It’s a miracle!
#Mizuki
:Perhaps… these feelings I’ve developed you have grounded me back to the earth, and my spirit is being given another chance to live a life without regrets. Maybe… just maybe… this is a gift from my mentor. That is… if you reciprocate these feelings I harbour.
#Y/N
:Of course I do! How could I not?
#
:<i>Mizuki blushes momentarily before tightening her grip on Y/N. Turning her head, she plants a soft kiss on Y/N’s cheek.
#Mizuki
:I look forward to watching the sakura bloom with you for many seasons to come.
#
:<i>As they’re locked in a tight embrace, Mizuki drops the sword as it fades into sparkles.

#Alomar
:Truly, I wished I could have explored more. 
#
:<i>His eyes wander the room, and he deeply sighs. 
#Alomar
:Thank you so much for taking me around the city, I really enjoyed its sights. There is so much of the world to see, so little of a lifetime to explore everything. 
#Y/N
:I hope wherever you go, you get to meet with your crew again. Travel the world once more. 
#Alomar
:I do too! And I’ll tell them all about you! 
#
:<i>Alomar grabs Y/N’s hands. 
#Alomar
:Thanks for listening to me, Y/N! I hope I wasn’t too much of a bother!

#Alomar
:Y/N! Look! I’m real again! 
#
:<i>Y/N touches his face too. Like kids, Y/N and Alomar jump up and down. They scream in joy.
#Y/N
:You are! 
#Alomar
:I must like you so much that it’s weighing me down! So much that I’ve become human again! I’ll see my crew at another time. They’d want me to take this opportunity to live once more. 
#Y/N
:What are you going to do now, Alomar? There’s so much to see in the world; what is your first course of action?
#
:<i>Alomar begins to pull on Y/N’s hand and drags them through the door.
#Alomar
:Let’s go on another drive, on a much longer one! Come on, let’s go see the sea! 
#
:<i>As they run out the door, Alomar drops the sash as it fades into sparkles.
