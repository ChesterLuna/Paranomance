#Y/N
:I am a historian. I graduated at the top of my class and I have been researching every culture in the world ever since!

#
:<i>This is what Y/N says to themselves, but in fact they only write video essays on their youtube channel and buy tons of books about different moments in human history.
#
:<i>It’s fun.
#Y/N
:I recently inherited a house from my creepy uncle. I guess he didn't have anyone else to give stuff to. So now I live in a mansion with 7 rooms and I have a ton of money!
#Y/N
:I love it, I can just chill wherever I want and there's no one to disturb my very important work.
#Y/N
:Although this place feels kind of empty… Other than my books and myself, I’m all alone…
#Y/N
:Oh I know! I need to get stuff to decorate the place. Illwill<i><sup>tm</sup></i> should be a good place for it.

#
:<i>Y/N drives to Illwill<i><sup>tm</sup></i> searching for trinkets to fill their new house. They go through each section skimming for something that looks expensive.
#
:<i>After a couple of minutes of Y/N going around the aisles, they find something that catches their eye…

#Y/N
:WHAT?! This is a sash from the early 1700s, it probably belonged to a pirate!
#Y/N
:And this is a broken samurai sword from the Tokugawa shogunate.
#Y/N
:And of course, the intricacy of this locket can only be addressed to the Victorian Era.

#Y/N
:How can they have these invaluable artifacts in the same section as souvenirs from Cancun! I have to buy them.

#
:<i>Y/N goes to the counter and pays 420.69 cents from their uncle's life insurance. Then they drive back to their uncle's mansion.

#Y/N
:<i>(Entering the mansion)</i> I could write a paper about every object here. I might even discover something important about human history.

#Y/N
:I would finally be able to use my history major for something useful.

#Y/N
:Although…
#Y/N
:I can just chill and exhibit them in my new mansion!

#
:<i>At that moment, Y/N trips on the rug and drops the cardboard box with all the objects on the floor. They all fell in front of them. 
#Y/N
:Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo!

#
:<i>The locket breaks and all the pieces scatter to the ground. The samurai sword breaks even more. And the sash gracefully hovers to the ground…

#
:<i>Until a chandelier falls and lights up the sash in flames.
$ Animation Blinking Blue
#
:<i>Y/N laments to themselves for destroying such valuable artifacts when suddenly… Three blue figures appear in front of Y/N, coming from inside the objects.
#
:<i>Slowly the blue tint fades away and Y/N is left in a room with three peculiarly dressed characters.

#Unknown Hunk
:HAAAAARR!
#
:<i>The figure dressed as a pirate stumbles and screams.
#Mysteriously Dressed Person
:What is this trickery!?
#
:<i>A person with a British accent and fancy clothes examines the room.
#Aggressive Lady
:YOU! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME! WHERE ARE WE?
#
:<i>The girl with green hair looks at Y/N angrily.
#Y/N
:What is going on!? What are you doing here!?

#Y/N
:Wait… You guys… I know those clothes! You are all wearing clothes from the periods of the antiques I gathered!

#Mysteriously Dressed Person
:Who are you calling an antique!?

#
:<i>Y/N starts to ramble about everything they know about the different time periods and their fun facts. The muscular guy tries to stop them but they are in the zone.

#Mizuki
:Stop! Okay, I can see that we are going to be here for a while so I think some presentations are in order. My name is Mizuki.
#Ollie
:Ollie is my name, a pleasure.
#Alomar
:And I am the great Alomar!
#Alomar
:But wait! Why do you know so much about me?
#Y/N
:I have tons of history books talking about you guys!
#Mizuki
:But my life is no history, all of these things happened a few months ago.
#Y/N
:But, these books are hundreds of years old. Could it be…?
#Y/N
:YOU ARE GHOSTS!?
#The three of them
:WE ARE GHOSTS!?
$ Animation Scatter
#
:<i>The three of them scatter around the place. Alomar is opening and slamming doors trying to escape. Ollie is crying loudly on the floor. Mizuki is frozen looking at a certain point.

#
:<i>Suddenly Y/N starts to hear a voice in their head amidst the chaos.
#Mysterious Voice
:<i>(Echoing)</i> Ohh, I see that you’ve brought some babes into my mansion.
#Y/N
:Creep- <i>(Y/N stops mid sentence)</i> My favorite uncle? What are you doing here?
#Creepy Uncle
:I see that you are surprised. Don’t sweat it, your cool uncle just delved a little into the <i>DARK</i> arts.
#Y/N
:WHAT? What did you do?! Why are these guys here?!
#
:<i>Y/N looks back at the ghosts suffering the knowledge of their own death.
#Creepy Uncle
:Don’t worryyy! Just chill and hangout with these dudes for 7 days and something interesting might happen! Maybe watch some MeshFlix<i><sup>tm</sup></i> if you know what I-
#Y/N
:Stop. What are you talking about? What type of magic did you cast? What is going to happen? Why 7 days?!
#Creepy Uncle
:Oh sorry! <i>(Their voice is fading)</i> I think I’m going through a ghostly tunnel! 
#
:<i>Y/N slapped their face.
#Y/N
:He was always really weird. This is going to be a long week.
#Y/N
:<i>(Screaming at the top of their lungs)</i> I guess we’ll be living together for a while. You may use the facilities of the mansion as you like.
#Y/N
:You can explore everything so please get accustomed to the place. We’ve got a lot to learn from each other.

#Mizuki
:<i>(Looking at a random point in the room, traumatized)</i> Yeah, we will…

#
:<i>Suddenly Y/N hears the creepy voice again.
#Creepy Uncle
:Oh yeah, quick note! Each night, click a person’s portrait to talk to them and try to pick the right thing to say to woo them!
#Creepy Uncle
:Once you’ve spent three nights with at least one of them, you can fast forward to the last night.
#Creepy Uncle
:But feel free to take all seven nights and try to get to know them as well as you can, if you know what I mean!
#Creepy Uncle
:<i>(Their voice is fading)</i> Going through a ghostly tunnel! Happy wooing!
