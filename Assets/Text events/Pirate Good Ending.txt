:Y/N… I know our time was short but thank you for accompanying me in my last moments on this earth.
#Mizuki
:I died with many regrets but… your presence has given me the gift of renewal. Perhaps now, I can pass on peacefully.
#Y/N
:I’m glad that I was able to provide some comfort to you. 
#Mizuki
:You did, I truly appreciated it.
#
:<i>Mizuki curls the corners of her mouth ever so slightly.
#Mizuki
:It was an honour to meet you, Y/N. It would be wonderful if we could meet again when your time comes.
#Y/N
:(sentimental) Without a doubt, I’ll come find you.
#Mizuki
:I look forward to it.
#
:<i>Light rises from her feet, and he slowly becomes transparent. The sound of sparkles faintly hums as she disappears.
#Mizuki
:May your light never be dimmed, in life or death. 
#
:<i>Mizuki gives Y/N a small bow before disappearing into the light, taking the sword with her.

#Ollie
:I know we only just met Y/N, but you made me realize so much… You showed me how to love again, when I thought I was hopeless.
#Ollie
:You made me feel as though I wasn’t alone during my loneliest times… I’ll always remember you.
#Ollie
:And perhaps I won’t feel as though I’ve left so much behind this time… You’ll keep my letters, right? 
#
:<i>Y/N blinks their eyes, trying to keep tears from escaping. 
#Y/N
:Yes Ollie. Of course I’ll keep them. 
#Ollie
:Good… Perhaps you can still mail them all out for me… Ah, right. I almost forgot. 
#Ollie
:Be sure to check under your pillow. I left one last special note, just for you. 
#Y/N
:Ollie… I have something for you too.
#
:<i>Y/N pulls a letter from their pocket, handing it to Ollie.
#Y/N
:I want you to take it with you… to remember me and our time together.
#
:<i>Ollie gives a sad smile. 
#Ollie
:Oh, Y/N. I’d never forget you. 
#
:<i>Light rises from their feet, and they slowly become transparent. The sound of sparkles faintly hums as they disappear.
#
:<i>Ollie closes their eyes, bracing what’s to come, the locket clutched tightly in one hand, the letter in the other, before disappearing.

#Alomar
:Guess this it, Y/N! I’ve learned so much in this time period. How amazing is it to travel so fast on land, to have all the books and knowledge of the world at your fingertips. 
#Alomar
:Truly, I wished I could have explored more. 
#
:<i>His eyes wander the room, and he deeply sighs. 
#Alomar
:Thank you so much for taking me around the city, I really enjoyed its sights. There is so much of the world to see, so little of a lifetime to explore everything. 
#Y/N
:I hope wherever you go, you get to meet with your crew again. Travel the world once more. 
#Alomar
:I do too! And I’ll tell them all about you! 
#
:<i>Alomar grabs Y/N’s hands. 
#Alomar
:Thanks for listening to me, Y/N! I hope I wasn’t too much of a bother!
#
:<i>Light rises from his feet, and the sound of sparkles faintly hums.
#Alomar
:Wait, what’s going on?
#
:<i>Y/N tilts their head, thinking that Alomar would be disappearing to the afterlife. But he becomes more human. A bright light blasts from his feet, blinding Y/N.
#
:<i>The bright light fades. Y/N feels the warmth of his skin and sees the light in his eyes. 
#
:<i>Alomar stares at his hands and touches his face, shocked. He slowly lifts his hands to cup Y/N’s face. His face fades from surprise to affinity.
#Alomar
:Y/N! Look! I’m real again! 
#
:<i>Y/N touches his face too. Like kids, Y/N and Alomar jump up and down. They scream in joy.
#Y/N
:You are! 
#Alomar
:I must like you so much that it’s weighing me down! So much that I’ve become human again! I’ll see my crew at another time. They’d want me to take this opportunity to live once more. 
#Y/N
:What are you going to do now, Alomar? There’s so much to see in the world; what is your first course of action?
#
:<i>Alomar begins to pull on Y/N’s hand and drags them through the door.
#Alomar
:Let’s go on another drive, on a much longer one! Come on, let’s go see the sea! 
#
:<i>As they run out the door, Alomar drops the sash as it fades into sparkles.
