:Guess this it, Y/N! I’ve learned so much in this time period. How amazing is it to travel so fast on land, to have all the books and knowledge of the world at your fingertips. 
#Alomar
:Truly, I wished I could have explored more. 
#
:His eyes wander the room, and he deeply sighs. 
#Alomar
:Thank you so much for taking me around the city, I really enjoyed its sights. There is so much of the world to see, so little of a lifetime to explore everything. 
#Y/N
:I hope wherever you go, you get to meet with your crew again. Travel the world once more. 
#Alomar
:I do too! And I’ll tell them all about you! 
#
:Alomar grabs Y/N’s hands. 
#Alomar
:Thanks for listening to me, Y/N! I hope I wasn’t too much of a bother!
#
:Light rises from his feet, and the sound of sparkles faintly hums.
#Alomar
:Wait, what’s going on?
#
:Y/N tilts their head, thinking that Alomar would be disappearing to the afterlife. But he becomes more human. A bright light blasts from his feet, blinding Y/N.
#
:The bright light fades. Y/N feels the warmth of his skin and sees the light in his eyes. 
#
:Alomar stares at his hands and touches his face, shocked. He slowly lifts his hands to cup Y/N’s face. His face fades from surprise to affinity.
#Alomar
:Y/N! Look! I’m real again! 
#
:Y/N touches his face too. Like kids, Y/N and Alomar jump up and down. They scream in joy.
#Y/N
:You are! 
#Alomar
:I must like you so much that it’s weighing me down! So much that I’ve become human again! I’ll see my crew at another time. They’d want me to take this opportunity to live once more. 
#Y/N
:What are you going to do now, Alomar? There’s so much to see in the world; what is your first course of action?
#
:Alomar begins to pull on Y/N’s hand and drags them through the door.
#Alomar
:Let’s go on another drive, on a much longer one! Come on, let’s go see the sea!
