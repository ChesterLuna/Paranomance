:<i>As Y/N heads to their room, they pass by the common room. They see a light peaking out from under the door frame. 
#
:<i>Y/N pushes the door open and hears the crackling sound of the fireplace. Alomar sits in front of it. She looms over his shoulder. 
#Y/N
:(curious) What are you doing?
#Alomar
:Y/N! You’re done with your work! 
#Y/N
:And it’s late, Alomar. What are you doing still awake? 
#
:<i>Y/N looks down to the floor in front of Alomor. A board of chess lies flat, with its pieces in disordered places. 
#Alomar
:Can’t sleep. Trying to figure out this modern game of yours. I hope you don’t mind, I found it on top of the table, but then I got cold. 
#
:<i>Alomar hugs his legs tighter. He puts his chin on his knees, and stares up at Y/N.
#Aloma
: If you’re not busy, would you like to…
[DECISION 1

Choice 1: I suppose I have a few minutes to spare. (-1)
Choice 2: I’d love to keep you company, Alomar. (+1) 

1#Alomar
1:Thank you for your time.

2#Alomar
2:Really?!

#Y/N
:Y/N takes a seat beside him. She extends her hands to feel the warmth of the fire. 
#Y/N
:You know, it takes two to play this game. There’s a manual somewhere…
#Alomar
:How about you teach me? If it isn’t so much trouble. 
#
:<i>Before Alomar can finish his sentence, Y/N is already setting up the board. 
#
:<i>She explains the basic rules of chess, the function of each piece and the objective of the game. Alomar leans in, with a hand to his chin, listening intently to Y/N.
#Alomar
:So all these pieces, all serve one purpose, can only move in specific ways. And to win, you must take… that king piece. 
#Y/N
:That’s the game.
#Alomar
:Interesting. You modern folk are entertained by the most mundane things. 
#
:<i>Y/N frowns. 
[DECISION 2

Choice 1: Shall I go to bed then? (-1)
Choice 2: Did I bore you, Alomar? (+1) 

1#Alomar
1: Y/N, I didn’t mean it in that way!

2#Alomar
2: Of course not! How could you even think that?!

#Alomar
:On the ship, we played games such as who can clean the desk the fastest or who can spit the furthest. I meant no offence, Y/N! I, too, am enthralled by the simplest of things!
#
:<i>Y/N covers her laugh with the back of her hand. 
#Y/N
:Why call it mundane?
#Alomar
:(clueless) There’s nothing wrong with mundanity. For example, you live in a large house, study history for a career and eat when you wish.
#Alomar
:I, on the other hand, never had the time to ever slow down. Following orders, cleaning decks, polishing wood, and finding ways to escape starvation.
#Alomar
:Simple games like these are nice, Y/N. I’ve always sought something grounding. 
#
:<i>Alomar stares into Y/N’s face and sends her a wink and smirk. He returns to his competitive demeanour. 
#Alomar
:Shall we play, Y/N? 
[DECISION 3

Choice 1: Don’t worry, I’ll go easy on you. (-1)
Choice 2: Cheeky, are we? Challenge accepted, pirate! (+1) 

1#Alomar
1:Don’t look down on me; there is no need. I like a challenge.
2#
2:Alomar smiles wide and makes the first move. 
2#Alomar
2:(playful) Watch your tongue, historian!
