:<i>As Y/N tries to immerse themselves in their work, they hear the sound of water splashing. 
#Y/N
:Alomar, again?
#
:<i>They close the book with a snap and make their way down the pool. They find Alomar, staring at his reflection. He dips a toe into the water, and immediately flinches back. 
#
:<i>Y/N had a feeling that Alomar harboured some sort of fear of water, but they didn’t know it was this severe. 
#Y/N
:(playful) Oh? That’s not something you see every day. 
#Alomar
:A ghost? 
#Y/N
:A pirate, an adventurer of the seas, afraid of water itself.
#Alomar
:Shameful, isn’t it?

[DECISION 1

1#Alomar
1:Come on, be honest. A pirate fearful of the sea. Unheard of.

2:You sound like the members of my crew!

#Alomar
:The fears only got worse when I died. 
#Y/N
:When you died?
#Alomar
:Ah, I didn’t mean to bring the mood down. 
#Y/N
:It’s okay, I want to know. 
#Alomar
:The ending of every pirate’s story is almost always the same. A storm in the middle of the night. The crashing waves, and the skies’ lightning hit the ship, breaking the keel in half.
#Alomar
:One of the youngest of us, one of the beams of the sail fell on her and…
#
:<i>Alomar’s face went dark, sullen with sadness. 
#Alomar
:Everyone had already evacuated on the sulls. I did what I had to do to save her. 
#
:<i>Y/N scoots closer to him. Put their head on his shoulder. 
#Y/N
:I’m so sorry. 
#Alomar
:It’s all the past, right? I’ve read a few of your books, it seems like my crew survived for quite a while. I bet that young girl lived a long life too.
#Alomar
:All I am left is this sash to remember them all by. But it’s a little sad, how I’m left all alone again. 
#
:<i>Alomar turns to Y/N. His expression changes, going back to his outgoing and happy self. 
#Alomar
:Let’s talk about something else! The pool! Do you swim?
#Y/N
:Just a little. But haven’t swam in a while. 
#Alomar
:Even though you have this massive pool in your own home?
[DECISION 2

Choice 1: My father liked to swim. I’m indifferent. (-1)
Choice 2: Haven’t really got into it yet. (+1)

1#Alomar
1:That’s too bad, Y/N. I thought you could entertain me today.
1#Alomar
1:So you’re considering it? Well, I’ll look forward to the day when you have the time.

#Alomar
:Well, I apologize for taking your time. You were doing your research work, weren’t you? I’ll leave you to it, darling. You don’t have to worry about it. 
#
:Y/N hums and stands from the side of the pool. She puts her hands on her hips and takes a breath in. 
[DECISION 3

Choice 1: Y/N jumps into the pool. (+1)
Choice 2: Y/N goes back to their research. (-1)

1#Alomar
1:What are you doing?!
1#Y/N
1:The water is cool!
1#Alomar
1:(cheeky) You’re crazy! In formal wear?! 
1#Y/N
1:The water isn’t so bad, Alomar, see?
1#
1:<i>Speechless, Alomar begins to laugh. 
1#Y/N
1:Alomar, you’re not alone anymore. So take the time you need to overcome your fear, find yourself, or whatever. There is nothing to apologize for. You are not a bother at all. 
1#
1:<i>Frozen, Alomar nods. 
1#Y/N
1:Aw, cat got your tongue, pirate?
1#
1:<i>Alomar blushes and looks away. He laughs. 
1#Alomar
1:You’re insane, Y/N. Insane. 

2#Alomar
2:Good luck, Y/N. I wish you the best in your research! Thank you for listening to my woes!
