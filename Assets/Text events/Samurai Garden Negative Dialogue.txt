:<i>Mizuki is seated outside in the garden, her eyes shut in concentration. She takes deep breaths, fully immersed in her meditation. She then stands and suddenly opens her eyes.
#Mizuki
:Phew… Ha! Ha! HAAA! 
#
:<i>Mizuki quickly strikes and kicks the air with perfect precision.
#Y/N
:What’re you doing?
#
:<i>Mizuki jumps in surprise.
#Mizuki
:KU--! Oh, it’s just you. 
#
:<i>Mizuki sighs in exasperation.
#Mizuki
:Don’t sneak up on me like that.
#Y/N
:I didn’t though… Shouldn’t a samurai be more attentive to her surroundings?
#
:<i>Mizuki purses her lips and furrows her brows as she steps towards the flower garden.
#Mizuki
:It’s not as if a ghost can be killed. Anyways, you’ve interrupted my training.
#Y/N
:What are you even training for when you’re a ghost?
#
:<i>Mizuki scoffs coldly as her gaze pierces Y/N.
#Mizuki
:Training isn’t just about preparing for battle; it hones your body and mind with discipline. You must attune yourself to nature itself and become one with the skies, waters, and earth.


[DECISION 1
    CHOICE 1: That must be intense, I don’t know that I could do it. () -1
    CHOICE 2: Interesting, maybe I could try to train with you sometime. () +1

1#Mizuki
1:Well, if you never try, you’d never know now would you?

2#Mizuki
2: Feel free to join, I’ve trained many a soldier back in the army.

:<i>Mizuki gazes at the various flowers, examining the various types populating your garden.
#Mizuki
:I must say though, your garden is quite beautiful.
#Y/N
:Thanks, I cultivated them all myself!
#
:<i>Mizuki nods in acknowledgment.
#Mizuki
:It’s admirable. To nurture life requires its own type of discipline, different from that which I practice to take away lives…
#Mizuki
:When I was on the battlefield, during my breaks I’d often slip away to nearby flower fields to calm my mind. Although I haven’t seen most of the flowers you have here back in Japan…
#
:<i>Mizuki looks up at a tree as her eye is caught by vibrant pink flowers in full bloom.
#Mizuki
:Ah, sakura, how beautiful.
#Y/N
:We call these cherry blossoms here.
#Mizuki
:Cherry blossoms… Tell me, Y/N, do you know what cherry blossoms symbolize where I’m from?

[DECISION 2
    CHOICE 1: Joy and optimism? () -1
    CHOICE 2: Life and death? () +1
1#Mizuki
1:<i>(in disappointment)</i> Perhaps to some extent, but that was not the answer I was looking for.

2#Mizuki
2:<i>(nods solemnly)</i> Correct.

#Mizuki
:You must know how quickly sakura falls after blooming. They are often a metaphor for the fleeting lives of us samurai who followed the code of bushido: discipline, respect, virtue. We face death fearlessly… Much like my mentor, a true warrior to the very end.
#
:<i>Mizuki grits her teeth.
#Mizuki
:And yet, despite the prospects of certain death, still new samurai follow this path courageously, ensuring the neverending rebirth of the samurai’s honour.
#Mizuki
:Life and death; beauty and violence, such dichotomous concepts. Yet, my mentor taught me without one, the other ceases to exist.

[DECISION 3:
    CHOICE 1: Your mentor must have been very wise. () +1
    CHOICE 2: Your mentor must have been very intrepid. () -1

1#Mizuki
1:Yes, though a warrior, he was wiser than any scholar out there.

2#Mizuki
2:I wouldn’t say that, he battled not seeking adventure but to uphold righteousness.

#Mizuki
:I wonder if he has found peace and been reborn, like these beautiful blossoms… or perhaps he is roaming this Earth as an apparition as well…
#Y/N
:Perhaps that may be… it’s hard to tell. In any case, one end means a new beginning.
#
:<i>Y/N smiles and Mizuki averts her eyes. She then turns towards Y/N.
#Mizuki
:You know, there’s another meaning to sakura.
#
:<i>Y/N tilts their head curiously.
#Y/N
:And what might that be?
#Mizuki
:They say that in China, they are linked to women’s ability to weaponize their beauty and sexuality to dominate.
#
:<i>Y/N nods in understanding.
#Y/N
:Is that where you got the name, the Blooming Blade?
#
:<i>Mizuki nods firmly.
#Mizuki
:If those bastards are going to underestimate me, I might as well have taken advantage of it. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to get back to my training.
