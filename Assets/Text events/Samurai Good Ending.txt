#Alomar
:Guess this it, Y/N! I’ve learned so much in this time period. How amazing is it to travel so fast on land, to have all the books and knowledge of the world at your fingertips. 
#Alomar
:Truly, I wished I could have explored more. 
#Y/N
:I hope wherever you go, you get to meet with your crew again. 
#Alomar
:I do too! And I’ll tell them all about you! 
#
:<i>Alomar grabs Y/N’s hands. 
#Alomar
:Thanks for listening to me, Y/N! I hope I wasn’t too much of a bother!
#Y/N
:(sentimental) You really weren’t. I enjoyed your company. 
#Alomar
:That puts me at ease. 
#
:<i>Light rises from his feet, and he slowly becomes transparent. The sound of sparkles faintly hums as he disappears.
#Alomar
:It was a pleasure getting to know you. I’m glad I got to know you! 
#
:<i>Alomar gives Y/N a wink and a small wave before disappearing into the light, taking the sash with them.

:I know we only just met Y/N, but you made me realize so much… You showed me how to love again, when I thought I was hopeless.
#Ollie
:You made me feel as though I wasn’t alone during my loneliest times… I’ll always remember you.
#Ollie
:And perhaps I won’t feel as though I’ve left so much behind this time… You’ll keep my letters, right? 
#
:<i>Y/N blinks their eyes, trying to keep tears from escaping. 
#Y/N
:Yes Ollie. Of course I’ll keep them. 
#Ollie
:Good… Perhaps you can still mail them all out for me… Ah, right. I almost forgot. 
#Ollie
:Be sure to check under your pillow. I left one last special note, just for you. 
#Y/N
:Ollie… I have something for you too.
#
:<i>Y/N pulls a letter from their pocket, handing it to Ollie.
#Y/N
:I want you to take it with you… to remember me and our time together.
#
:<i>Ollie gives a sad smile. 
#Ollie
:Oh, Y/N. I’d never forget you. 
#
:<i>Light rises from their feet, and they slowly become transparent. The sound of sparkles faintly hums as they disappear.
#
:<i>Ollie closes their eyes, bracing what’s to come, the locket clutched tightly in one hand, the letter in the other, before disappearing.

#Mizuki
:Y/N… I know our time was short but thank you for accompanying me in my last moments on this earth. I died with many regrets but… 
#Mizuki
:Your presence has given me the gift of renewal.
#Mizuki
:Perhaps now, I can pass on peacefully, with the belief that my mentor holds no blame against me.
#
:<i>She purses her lips, seeming to search for words.
#Mizuki
:I cherished every moment we spent together. Truly. I am glad our paths crossed in spite of the vastness of our universe.
#Y/N
:I’m glad that I was able to provide some comfort to you. Perhaps you’ll be able to reunite with your mentor in the afterlife. I’m sure there’ll be much to say between you two.
#Mizuki
:If I do manage to meet him again, I’ll be sure to speak of you.
#
:<i>Mizuki curls the corners of her mouth ever so slightly.
#Mizuki
:It was an honour to meet you, Y/N. It would be wonderful if we could meet again when your time comes.
#
:<i>Light rises from her feet, and the sound of sparkles faintly hums as she disappears.
#Mizuki
:What– what’s going on?
#
:<i>Y/N tilts their head, thinking that Mizuki would be disappearing to the afterlife. But she becomes more human. A bright light blasts from her feet, blinding Y/N.
#
:<i>The bright light fades. Y/N feels the warmth of her skin and sees the light in her eyes. 
#
:<i>Mizuki stares at her hands and touches her face, shocked. She carefully reaches her hand out to hold Y/N’s hand. Her face fades from surprise to affinity.
#Mizuki
:I– I think I’m human again.
#
:<i>Y/N grasps Mizuki’s hand back, pulling her into a gentle embrace. Silent tears gather in Mizuki’s eyes.
#Y/N
:It’s a miracle!
#Mizuki
:Perhaps… these feelings I’ve developed you have grounded me back to the earth, and my spirit is being given another chance to live a life without regrets.
#Mizuki
:Maybe… just maybe… this is a gift from my mentor. That is… if you reciprocate these feelings I harbour.
#Y/N
:Of course I do! How could I not?
#
:<i>Mizuki blushes momentarily before tightening her grip on Y/N. Turning her head, she plants a soft kiss on Y/N’s cheek.
#Mizuki
:I look forward to watching the sakura bloom with you for many seasons to come.
#
:<i>As they’re locked in a tight embrace, Mizuki drops the sword as it fades into sparkles.
