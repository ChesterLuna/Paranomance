:<i>In the kitchen, Mizuki attempts to chop vegetables carefully. She struggles, whispering her irritations. 
#MIZUKI
:Ugh… Blast this blade, its handle is too smooth… And why aren’t the pieces coming out even? 
#
:<i>Mizuki slowly and clumsily continues chopping until in frustration. 
#MIZUKI
:AGH, くそ！
#
:<i>Mizuki sends the knife down, slicing straight through the cutting board. She breathes heavily, then freezes. She gasps. 
#MIZUKI
:O-oh no, what have I done? 
#
:<i>Mizuki hastily tries to push the pieces back together. She hears footsteps behind her, realizing Y/N has walked into the kitchen. 
#Y/N
:Uhh, hey, are you okay?
#MIZUKI
:Oh, yes! I’m doing perfectly fine! 
#
:<i>Mizuki attempts to conceal the mess she made. Y/N raises an eyebrow. 
#Y/N
:This doesn’t look like it’s “perfectly fine”.
#
:<i>Mizuki sighs. 
#MIZUKI
:Well, maybe it’s not perfectly fine. 
#
:<i>She moves out of the way to show the sliced cutting board. Y/N whistles in awe. 
#Y/N
:Sliced clean through, you’d think it was just spare pieces of driftwood. Guess I’ll have to replace it.
#
:<i>Mizuki blushes and grumbles. 
#MIZUKI
:I was hoping at least as a ghost, I’d have better cooking skills but it seems I only have hands for drawing blood…

[DECISION 1
    CHOICE 1: Don’t worry, we all have our own strengths, you’re doing good. -1
    CHOICE 2: Drawing blood? I take it you were a samurai? 1

1:(irked) Don’t patronize me, you heard me!

2#Girl
2:(proudly) Yes, you’d be correct in assuming so

#MIZUKI
:I was one of the most fearsome warriors amongst my squadron. They called me the ***, you know. Of course, being a woman, you have to fight for your place and prove yourself; weakness is unacceptable. Otherwise, I’d never have been respected, just like before I turned to the way of the blade…
#
:<i>Y/N cleaning up the mess. 
#Y/N
:You must have many stories to tell then.
#MIZUKI
:No one expected me to survive on the battlefield, much less excel. But one person believed me and from then on, nothing stood in our way, that is, except until… 
#
:<i>Mizuki goes sullen. 
[DECISION 2
    CHOICE 1: <i>Who’s this “person”? A comrade? -1
    CHOICE 2: Hm, how about we lift the mood with a meal? 1

1#Mizuki
1:I’d rather not speak about it.

2#Mizuki
2: That… would be much appreciated.

#Y/N
:Well, I don’t know if ghosts have much of an appetite but is there anything in particular you’d like to eat?
#
:<i>Mizuki ponders momentarily. 
#MIZUKI
:You wouldn’t happen to have rice would you?
#
:<i>Y/N lets out a laugh.
#Y/N
:Just rice?
#MIZUKI
:Of course not! Vegetables, perhaps a bowl of miso soup. Oh, and a side dish should go alongside it. After all, a soldier can’t fight on an empty stomach. 
Y/N:
[DECISION 3

    CHOICE 1: How about beef? -1
    CHOICE 2: How about fish? 1
1#Girl
1:(distaste) That’s quite opulent of you… Shouldn’t you preserve your cattle to tend to your fields? I recall seeing fish in your ice box so let’s cook that instead.
2#Girl
2:(smiling slightly) That’d be quite nostalgic, it was a classic side dish amongst my infantry. And I do remember seeing fish in your ice box, yes I think that’d be perfect.

#MIZUKI
:I may not be able to execute it, but my old comrade told me a delectable recipe to cook fish. I’ll instruct you, and you can do the cooking.
#Y/N
:Roger that!
#MIZUKI
:Oh, and… 
#
:<i>She ducks her head. 
#MIZUKI
:Sorry for slicing through your board… 
#
:<i>She looks away and blushes subtly, unbeknownst to Y/N.
