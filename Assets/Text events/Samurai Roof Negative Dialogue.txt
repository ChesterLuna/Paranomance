:<i>Y/N finds Mizuki sitting on the roof. Her legs are crossed as she gazes at the vast night sky, dotted with a blanket of endless stars and punctuated by a full moon.
#Y/N
:Mizuki.
#
:<i>Mizuki remains unmoving, seemingly unbothered by your presence.
#Mizuki
:It’s very peaceful here. Tranquility like this is rare on the fields of battle.
#Y/N
:Well, this is out in the suburbs so not much goes on around here.
#Mizuki
:I think he… I mean, my mentor, would have liked it here. He always said that should he retire, he would have liked to live in the countryside, away from the cacophony of war.
#Y/N
:Your mentor… I don’t mean to pry, but if you’d be willing, I’d love to hear more about him.
#
:<i>Mizuki scrunches her eyebrows in distaste and goes silent. After a moment lost in thought, she sighs reluctantly.
#Mizuki
:He… was a great man, one who could see beyond the outer body and what truly lies within. 
#
:<i>Mizuki pauses once more, breathing slowly.
#Mizuki
:Before I was the Blooming Blade, I was just a daughter of a local noble. And what do you think happens to such daughters, Y/N?

1:<i>(laughs bitterly)</i> If only that were the case.
2#Mizuki
2:<i>(nods frustratedly)</i> That’s right.

#Mizuki
:It’s a story from days long gone. I was but a pawn to my father who intended to marry me off for an alliance. All my life, I knew my fate and had come to accept it.
#Mizuki
:But my mentor… wandering from town to town, he found me and recognized the light in me that had been dimmed by my duty.
#
:<i>Mizuki gazes up at the stars, a hard expression painting her face.
#Mizuki
:He saved me, helped me escape and took me in as his protégé. But… I couldn’t save him.
#
:<i>Mizuki grits her teeth in frustration as she digs her nails into her palms.
#Mizuki
:We were to engage in combat but we were ambushed. I promised my mentor that if a battle was to be lost, I was to end his life before the enemy could. But I failed.
#
:<i>Mizuki clenches her jaw as tension fills the air.
#Mizuki
:He tried to fight them off but those bastards managed to break his sword and pierced him straight through the heart without warning. I annihilated them in my rage but… it was too late.
#
:<i>Y/N notices Mizuki fiddling with the handle of the sword with the broken blade.
#Mizuki
:Soon after, I committed seppuku, hoping to follow my mentor to the afterlife. But instead, here I am… this must be my punishment for dishonouring him…

[DECISION 2
    CHOICE 1: You shouldn’t blame yourself, you did your best. () -1
    CHOICE 2: Perhaps there is some other reason why you manifested here instead. () +1

1#Mizuki
1:If that was my best, then clearly I am not fit to be a samurai.
2#Mizuki
2:That’s an intriguing thought, maybe that is so.

#Mizuki
:If only I could speak to him once more. Apologize for failing him. Thank him for the time he spent nurturing me. So many unspoken words for me to say.
#Y/N
:I may not know your mentor but I think he knows. Even if he’s no longer alive, I think his spirit can feel your heart and I’m sure he doesn’t blame you.
#
:<i>Mizuki scoffs indignantly.
#Mizuki
:How could you know the feelings of my mentor… Although maybe you’re right.
#Y/N
:I think he’d want you to be freed from your shackles of guilt. I— I hope you can let go.
#
:<i>Mizuki goes silent as she stares at the moon.
#Mizuki
:You know, my mentor bestowed the name Mizuki upon me after we escaped my household to christen my new life. It means the moon.
#Mizuki
:We’d watch the celestial bodies pass through the sky during night duty and he would always tell me.
#Mizuki
:“I hope the light of your spirit can remain unwavering and everlasting, just as when I first met you.”
[DECISION 3
    CHOICE 1: In that case, I’m certain you are doing him proud. (+1)
    CHOICE 2: That must be a lot of pressure on you. (-1)
1#Mizuki
1:I hope so.
1#Y/M
1:I know so. You’ve been shining brightly from the moment I met you.
1#
1:<i>Mizuki gives a soft and gentle smile, breaking her cool facade.
1#Mizuki
1:Say, shall we stargaze together? I’d like to tell some stories I’ve made up about those constellations, back when I was on the battlefield…

2#Mizuki
2:On the contrary, it’s a great honour to be believed in so deeply, when few others ever believed in me. It seems that he may remain as the only one to do so…
2#Mizuki
2:In any case, I think it’s time to turn in for the night. Let’s get down from here.
