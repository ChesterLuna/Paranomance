:<i>Y/N hears a wailing coming from the distance. They feel a chill run down their spine and shudder. 
#Y/N
:What was that? It sounded an awful lot like a ghost in the walls…
#
:<i>The wailing becomes louder this time. Y/N follows the sound and finds that it leads to a dimly lit washroom.
#Y/N
:AAAAAAAAAHHHHH!! IT'S A GHOST!
#Ollie
:Y/N, please. I really can't do this right now.
#
:<i>They say in between sobs. 
#Y/N
:Ollie! You scared me! You look like a ghost!
#
:<i>Ollie makes a face of disapproval. Y/N sees Ollie looking upset. Their pale face is tear-streaked.

#
:<i>Y/N looks around for the first time and sees candles illuminating an otherwise dark washroom. 
#Y/N
: Umm… What’s going on here?
#Ollie
:I was trying to contact someone… 
#Y/N
:Contact someone?
#
:<i>Y/N sees objects in front of Ollie; they seem to be in the middle of some sort of ritual. Ollie wipes their nose with their sleeve.
#Ollie
:You know, from the past. 
#Y/N
:…from the past?
#Ollie
:Dead people! A seance!


#
:<i>You look down to see a locket laying in the middle of the floor, surrounded by burning candles and paper. 
#Y/N
:What is that? Is that my locket?
#Ollie
:No! Of course not. I would never take your things like that. I brought this locket with me… I think it ties me to this realm.
#Ollie
:It is the locket of my deceased best friend whom I never fully recovered from… It’s all I had left, and I was hoping…
#
:<i>Ollie trails off.
#Y/N
:You need closure?
#Ollie
:It still hurts. I never got to say goodbye. She was here one minute, gone the next. She got very ill.
#Y/N
:It’s always very hard when you don’t get to say goodbye. Is that what you were trying to do?
#Ollie
:Yes… I wanted to see if I could somehow get in touch. See how it is on the other side. I’ve always been afraid of passing over.



[DECISION 2
    CHOICE 1: Do you join in and help? (+1)
    CHOICE 2: Call them ridiculous and creepy? (-1)

#Y/N
:Ollie… I’m sure there are better ways to do this.
#Ollie
:Like what? What could possibly be a better way of communicating than a seance? How could I possibly talk to them?
#Y/N
:Why don’t you try writing letters to them?
#Ollie
:Letters? That might not be a bad idea…

[DECISION 3
    CHOICE 1: Do you cheer Ollie up and wipe away their tears? (+1)
    CHOICE 2: Do you throw toilet paper rolls at them? -1

2:Ow…

:<i>Y/N extends a hand. 
#Y/N
:You’re not going to be able to get any writing done in here. Let’s get out of here, then.
