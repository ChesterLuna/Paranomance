:Guess this it, Y/N! I’ve learned so much in this time period. How amazing is it to travel so fast on land, to have all the books and knowledge of the world at your fingertips. 
#Alomar
:Truly, I wished I could have explored more. 
#Y/N
:I hope wherever you go, you get to meet with your crew again. 
#Alomar
:I do too! And I’ll tell them all about you! 
#
:<i>Alomar grabs Y/N’s hands. 
#Alomar
:Thanks for listening to me, Y/N! I hope I wasn’t too much of a bother!
#Y/N
:(sentimental) You really weren’t. I enjoyed your company. 
#Alomar
:That puts me at ease. 
#
:<i>Light rises from his feet, and he slowly becomes transparent. The sound of sparkles faintly hums as he disappears.
#Alomar
:It was a pleasure getting to know you. I’m glad I got to know you! 
#
:<i>Alomar gives Y/N a wink and a small wave before disappearing into the light, taking the sash with them.

:Y/N… I know our time was short but thank you for accompanying me in my last moments on this earth.
#Mizuki
:I died with many regrets but… your presence has given me the gift of renewal. Perhaps now, I can pass on peacefully.
#Y/N
:I’m glad that I was able to provide some comfort to you. 
#Mizuki
:You did, I truly appreciated it.
#
:<i>Mizuki curls the corners of her mouth ever so slightly.
#Mizuki
:It was an honour to meet you, Y/N. It would be wonderful if we could meet again when your time comes.
#Y/N
:(sentimental) Without a doubt, I’ll come find you.
#Mizuki
:I look forward to it.
#
:<i>Light rises from her feet, and he slowly becomes transparent. The sound of sparkles faintly hums as she disappears.
#Mizuki
:May your light never be dimmed, in life or death. 
#
:<i>Mizuki gives Y/N a small bow before disappearing into the light, taking the sword with her.

#Ollie
:I know we only just met Y/N, but you made me realize so much… You showed me how to love again, when I thought I was hopeless.
#Ollie
:You made me feel as though I wasn’t alone during my loneliest times… I’ll always remember you.
#Ollie
:And perhaps I won’t feel as though I’ve left so much behind this time…
#Ollie
:You’ll keep my letters, right? 
#
:<i>Y/N blinks their eyes, trying to keep tears from escaping. 
#Y/N
:Yes Ollie. Of course I’ll keep them. 
#Ollie
:Good… Perhaps you can still mail them all out for me… Ah, right. I almost forgot. 
#Ollie
:Be sure to check under your pillow. I left one last special note, just for you. 
#Y/N
:Ollie… I have something for you too.
#
:<i>Y/N pulls a letter sealed with a kiss from their pocket, handing it to Ollie.
#Y/N
:I want you to take it with you… to remember me and our time together.
#
:<i>Ollie gives a sad smile. 
#Ollie
:Oh, Y/N. I’d never forget you. 
#
:<i>Light rises from their feet, and they slowly become transparent. The sound of sparkles faintly hums.
#
:<i>Ollie closes their eyes, bracing what’s to come, the locket clutched tightly in one hand, the letter in the other.
#
:<i>Y/N tilts their head, thinking that Ollie would be disappearing to the afterlife. But they become more human. A bright light blasts from their feet, blinding Y/N.
#
:<i>The bright light fades. Y/N feels the warmth of their skin and sees the light in their eyes. 
#
:<i>Ollie stares at their hands and touches their face, shocked. They slowly lift their hands to cup Y/N’s face. Their face fades from surprise to affinity.
#Ollie
:Is it over? Am I dead? Why are you still here?
#
:<i>Y/N Ollie! I think you’re human again!
#Ollie
:What? Wait!!
#
:<i>Ollie pats themselves down again, and a smile lights up their entire face, for the first time. They have a really cute smile, you think. You want to see it more often, and now you can.
#Ollie
:I am real! I believe it was my feelings for you that kept me here. You would have known that if you had read that letter I left for you…
#Ollie
:But now I can tell you myself! This is my second chance at love…
#Ollie
:Do you love me too?
#
:<i>A smolder in Ollie’s eyes follows this question.
#Y/N
:Of course I love you, Ollie!
#
:<i>Ollie comes in for a hug. This is the first time they’ve ever felt so warm. It’s a weird contrast to their usual somber coolness. You could get used to this. 
#
:<i>You hear the clink of the locket fall to the ground and fade away into sparkles.
