#Y/N
:This really is a beautiful library… With all its shining wood architecture. And all these books! So much knowledge. I can finally get some peace and quiet. 
#
:<i>Suddenly, Y/N hears a very faint sound of scratching. They could easily miss it, but it becomes a discomfort to their ears. 
#Y/N
:Spoke too soon. What is that?
#
:<i>The scratching becomes more obvious. 
#Y/N
:Sounds like a pencil on paper? Really aggressive. Whoever that is seems to really have something to say. 
#
:<i>The scratching stops and is replaced by footsteps.
#Y/N
:Who’s up here?
#Y/N
:<i>Should I explore the sound?

:<i>Ollie jumps out from behind a shelf. 
#Ollie
:Boo!
#Y/N
:A-a-a A GHOST!! 
#Ollie
:I thought we would have gotten past this by now. 
#
:<i>Ollie deeply sighs. Y/N clutches their chest. 
#Y/N
:Ollie! You really have got to stop doing that. Gosh, this is going to take some getting used to.
#Ollie
:It’s nothing. 
#
:<i>Ollie starts backing up from the direction they came. Arms defensively in front of them. 
#
:<i>Y/N quizically follows Ollie, reaching a desk with things sprawled all across it. You see a candle lighting the space.
#
:<i>Romantic, you think. A feather quill, ink and a piece of paper lie on the desk.
#Y/N
:Are you writing something? 
#
:<i>Y/N tries to take a peak. But Ollie tries to hide the scene from view with their body. 
#Ollie
:I’m not doing anything.
#Y/N
:Ollie, you know I can see right through you, right? You’re not exactly… opaque. 
#Ollie
:Yes, well…
#
:<i>Ollie nervously adjusts their hair.
#Ollie
:I’m writing to my sister. She gets lonely when I don’t write to her often. She’s an awfully fretful woman, that one. 
#
:<i>Y/N stares at Ollie's face, questioning.
#Y/N
:You’re a little late for that, aren’t you?
#Ollie
:I was just… writing a letter. 
#
:<i>Ollie mumbles to themselves, refusing to make eye contact.
#Y/N
:What? What letter?
#
:<i>Ollie turns away. 
#Ollie
:You asked for a love letter, don’t you remember? 
#
:<i>Y/N looks at Ollie, dumbfounded at first, until the realization kicks in. They really are a hopeless romantic, you think.

#Ollie
:The letter wasn’t ready to be read yet. 
#
:<i>Ollie clumsily tries to collect everything on the desk. As they do this, The moonlight from the tall window above strikes their pale cheek, illuminating their sharp cheekbone.

[DECISION 3
    CHOICE 1: Have they always been this beautiful? +1
    CHOICE 2: They look like they’re sick and dying, even in death. -1
