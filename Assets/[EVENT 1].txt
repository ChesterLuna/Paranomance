#Alomar
:Car! What a wonderful name for your ship! Though, it’s a little small for my taste... Where do sails protrude? How does it work?
#Y/N
:It doesn’t need sails--
#Alomar
:What a time you live in! To travel on boat on land.

#Narrator
:He throws his hands up, and his eyes wander around the garage.
#Y/N
:Houses come in all different sizes too. You must have not been on land too often when you were alive, huh?
#Alomar
:I can count the number of times I’ve ever been on land, usually just to gather food for the rest of the crew. 
#Alomar
:They always told me to stay back whenever they had earthly affairs.
#Y/N
:But you were a pirate, right? You must gone on a lot of adventures to make up for it.
#Alomar
:Right again, Y/N.
#Narrator
:He winks at them.
#Alomar
:Your status as a historian doesn’t fail you.
#Alomar
:Yes, I did go on many adventures, traversing the seas, meeting people hailing from elsewhere, fighting all types of battles, eating like champions as a celebration.
#Narrator
:Alomar looks a little dejected.
#Alomar
:Is it selfish of me to yearn for so much more than just jubilance?

[CHOICE
Of course not. (+1)
Not many could have lived the life you did. (-1)

#Alomar
:Living my entire life with the crew is something I do not regret one bit. Nor is dying for the sake of them.
#Y/N
:Dying for the sake of them? What does that mean?
#Alomar
:But, Y/N, a simple life would be nice, you know? Though the seas have much to discover, I am far more fascinated by land. 
#Alomar
:Y/N, what do you think?
[CHOICE
Maybe sometime, I can take you for a drive! On my ship! We can take a tour around the city, if you’d like. (+1)
Entertain yourself as much as you want within the premises. Staying in this house is the best way to figure out how to get you to pass. (-1)

1:Alomar brightens.
1#Alomar
1:That sounds wonderful, Y/N! I’ll take that as a promise.
1#Narrator
1:Alomar gently takes Y/N’s hand and fiddles with their finger. Their pinky finger is left unfolded. He wraps his own finger around theirs.
1#Alomar
1:Don’t leave me waiting too long, okay?
2#Narrator
2:Alomar sighs.

2:Another order, I see. I’m no foreigner to it. As you wish, Y/N.
